\title{The $\ee \rarrow \mumu$ at Cross Section in the Standard Model}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	The Standard Model's (SM) prediction of particles beyond those initially considered by quantum electrodynamics (QED) will soon by tested in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. SPS will attempt $\Zzero$ production via the $\antibar{p}$ mechanism. We performed a numerical integration of the differential cross section of the $\ee \rarrow \mumu$ scattering process which may produce new $\Zzero$ bosons in the hope that the proposed Large Electron-Position collider (LEP) will verify this channel of $\Zzero$ production. A distinct $\Zzero$ resonance around the proposed $\Zzero$ mass of 91.8\GeV was found with a cross section $\sigma=9.4\inb$.
